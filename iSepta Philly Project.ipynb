    "__Goal:__ Guess the total number of SEPTA key taps done on Friday, December 20, 2019 _without going over._\n",

    "  - For purposes of this project, a \"key tap\" shall refer to a single use of a SEPTA key card for payment of fare.\n",

    "# OVERVIEW OF PROJECT\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to perform the following for our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Figure out what data to obtain.\n",
    "2. Where to go to obtain said data.\n",
    "3. Within the desired data, figure out what metric to use to determine SEPTA key taps.\n",
    "4. Perform data analysis and data modeling, assuming that there is enough available relevant data.\n",
    "5. Draw Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What Data includes SEPTA Key Card Taps?\n",
    "\n",
    "SEPTA key taps are done for fare on all four modes of Philadelphia public transportation: \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Subway (Market-Frankford Line (MFL) and Broad Street Line (BSL)) \n",
    "   2. Buses\n",
    "   3. Trolleys \n",
    "   4. Regional Rail Lines\n",
    "   \n",
    "SEPTA key cards were introduced tpo the public on February 9, 2017, according to the timeline set forth on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEPTA_Key).\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Data Limitation #1: No Historic Key Card Information for Regional Rail Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of SEPTA key cards is a recent change to Philadelphia's public transportation system, and indeed, SEPTA is still in the process of transitioning. Notably, the transition from standard payment to key taps for regional rail lines is [still in flux](https://www.inquirer.com/transportation/septa-key-regional-rail-rollout-travel-wallet-20191118.html). It is unclear when the transition will be completed; according to the Wikipedia timeline, as of now, the regional rail transition is still in its early adoption program phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, there is not sufficient information to determine what portion of regional rail riders are currently using the SEPTA key card as the transition is so new (and quite frankly, it is unclear if this is calculated into the total number on iSEPTA Philly's end).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we will not include regional rail ridership into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Limitation #2: Fares Paid without SEPTA Key Card\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the SEPTA key card has made fare tokens obsolete, individuals may still pay for fare via single \"quick trip\" purchases at digital kiosks or with cash via a SEPTA representative in person. As we will see, the data does not show a distinction between key tap ridership and non-key tap ridership.\n",

    "## 2. Where to Find SEPTA Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Philadelphia is fairly progressive in offering open data. Here are some open data links used to obtain the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __[SEPTA Open Data](http://septaopendata-septa.opendata.arcgis.com/):__ Provides .csv compilations of SEPTA statistics for each mode of transportation described above, along with aggregations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Federal Transit Adminsitration's [National Transit Database](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/what-national-transit-database-ntd-program):__ Has reports on all major public transportation systems, in both aggregated and raw data form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Various Aggregated Reports:__ These reports do not provide analyzable tabular data, but they are still good reference points/sanity checks for a ballpark estimation as to where are analyzed values should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _SEPTA Annual Reports_: Annual Reports provided by SEPTA itself, such as [this one for November 2019](http://septa.org/strategic-plan/pdf/2019-11-revenue-ride.pdf)!<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - _Center City District & Central Philadelphia Development Corporation_: Has Annual Reports such as this [2018 Annual Report](https://centercityphila.org/uploads/attachments/cjusnd2j40fjnukqdy7j9p2ng-socc-2019-transportation.pdf).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some open data links that seemed relevant but are __NOT__ used in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __[Scraped Septa-stats.com Data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3jnvonaqtmvc3wh/AACvwz3DMTXrW56P8xBUUIcSa?dl=0):__ This is voluminous data on each and every SEPTA service route and timestamps for each stop on each and every service route. This data does not include ridership or revenue stats - only the routes themselves.\n",
    "    - Plus...I am pretty sure the .json format is broken because a parsing error is thrown on the first line! I think there is no delimiter (i.e., comma) between json lines, and that is simply not worth fixing, especially for irrelevant data.\n",

For this reason, _I will manually enter the values_ from SEPTA's auditor [2018 to Q2 2019 fiscal report](http://septa.org/strategic-plan/reports/2019-audited-financials.pdf) and a [SEPTA November 2019 Performance Results Report](http://septa.org/strategic-plan/reports/board.pdf) .

    "There is no significant difference between the amount that a passenger pays on the weekdays and the amount a passenger pays on the weekends, which is a good premise to establish.\n",

    "#### Second (and arguably more foremost)...\n",
    "\n",
    "__REVENUE IS NOT A GOOD INDICATOR OF KEY TAPS OR OF RIDERSHIP!!!!!__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Question:__ Why is this?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> __Answer:__ To suggest that revenue is a good indicator of ridership would imply that people pay for single trips all the time. This is not true. Even though we excluded regional rail riders, individuals can still make purchases of week-long or month-long transportation passes. Additionally, SEPTA key cards cost \\\\$4.95. They must be purchased either at the beginning or if they get lost.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">These considerations would explain the gross under-reporting of revenue; if people did do single trip rides all the time, the average payment per person riding would indeed be \\\\$2 to \\\\$2.50.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The prices found in the histogram of about \\\\$1.20 do not reflect the actual price of SEPTA fare! Actual SEPTA fare is \\\\$2.00 for SEPTA key card usage and \\\\$2.50 for non-SEPTA key card payments (i.e., 1.25x the price of SEPTA key card price).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third: Does revenue still tell us something helpful?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Yes.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information, riders would fall into two main camps: those who use multi-day passes and those who don't. Multi-day pass riders would have wonky average payments because of the combination of buying the passes (or not) and some day payments. This leads to a much larger distribution of individual payment values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who don't, there should be two large peaks - those who pay by key tap and those who pay buy cash. If we can isolate those two large peaks, we can find the ___ratio___ between those who pay by key tap and those who don't, which is critical for this analysis. Indeed, we see this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - For the Total Passenger Distribution (blue), there are high peaks at __~1.15 and ~1.45__, which is about a 25\\% difference between the two.\n",
    " - For the Weekday Passenger Distribution (orange), there are high peaks at __~0.95 and ~1.2__, which is about a 25\\% difference between the two.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The no_outliers dataset gives us that clear __80/20__ picture when only using two bins (the outliers included dataset had less reliable peaks). This ratio is what we need to determine ridership.\n",
